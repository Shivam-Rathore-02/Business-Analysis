## Introduction

This Power BI project delivers a deep dive into sales, product, and customer data, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on actionable insights. The analysis covers multiple aspects, including sales trends, product performance, and customer retention, and aims to identify opportunities for growth and areas for improvement.

## Project Overview
